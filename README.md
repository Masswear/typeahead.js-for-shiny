typeahead.js for Shiny
===

This project documents one way to integrate a [typeahead.js](https://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js 'typeahead.js') UI component into a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com 'Shiny') applet (Shiny is a web application framework for R). This work was done to provide an intuitive, familiar, and easy-to-use Google-like "suggestion" box predicting the next word a user would type for [Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1 'Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization')'s capstone project.

This repository is a minimal but functional [demo](https://paspeur.shinyapps.io/typeahead-js-for-shiny 'typeahead.js for Shiny | Demo') showcasing the typeahead.js and Shiny integration. For a more complete example, check out the predictive text modeling project that used it [here](http://wordmaster.io 'wordmaster.io').
